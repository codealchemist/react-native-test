# React Native Test

Learning React Native ðŸ˜„

## Getting started

To try this example you'll need to:

- `npm i`
- `npm start`

The app was kickstarted using [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev).

You should get a prompt to install Expo globally.

Expo seems to be the easiest way to get started with React Native.

Other approaches involve installing native development tools (Android Studio / XCode).

## Styling

Styling was approached using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) which makes it more intuitive for devs comming from web.

## Components library

Started experimenting with [React Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/).
